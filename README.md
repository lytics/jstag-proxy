# jstag-proxy
a simple forward proxy for running jstag collection on another domain

**This is a proof of concept**

This repo contains a Dockerfile and a node.js forward proxy to demonstrate the ability to run Lytics collection and personalization from another domain besides https://c.lytics.io

The primary use-case for this is to bypass blockers that have c.lytics.io in their blocklist
